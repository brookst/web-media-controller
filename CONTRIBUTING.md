# How to add support for a website

This document assumes you have basic knowledge in JavaScript and Browser
extensions' API. If you'd like to learn more about the 'Web extensions' API
used by both Chrome and Firefox, please refer to [Mozilla's developer's
documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

This document will not attempt to spare you from reading the source code which
it's comments are the most reliable source for documentation. As for adding
a specific website support, refer to
[`content/base-connector.js`](content/base-connector.js) which defines the base
class for every connector in [`connectors/`](connectors/).

Here are the key notes you should consider when attempting to write
a connector:

## Override `get controlsInfo()` according to your connectors capabilities

As it's name may suggest, this method tells the extension what your connector
can do. For example, on YouTube, this needs to be dynamically set - when
watching a video not within a playlist, you shouldn't be able to go the
previous video, meaning `canGoPrevious` should be `false`.

This method is kind of important. It shouldn't break anything if it's not
defined properly but MPRIS clients may check this information so you don't want
them to be mislead.

## Watch for DOM changes

In order for your connector to actually do something, it needs to be aware of
certain elements in the web page and watch them. This will hint the connector
to update the status of the playback for example and allow MPRIS clients to
actually control the web page.

Assigning a CSS selector of a player element to the `playerSelector` property
will make the connector to watch for changes of this element.

## Lint your code

Run `npx grunt eslint:target` to check if your code conforms to the project code style.
`npx grunt eslint:fix` might fix some errors for you automatically. Please make sure
`npx grunt eslint:target` reports no errors before sumbitting pull request.

Please don't disable `eslint` rules in files. The one exception is scripts located
in `src/inject`: they could use website internals (which of course might not conform
to this project code style), so feel free to disable some rules in these scripts
(see `src/inject/vk.js` for example). Warnings reported by `eslint` could be
discussed. Errors could also be discussed but only if you're absolutely sure
you need to break some rule to implement a feature or fix some bug.

I'd also ask you to set up your editor or IDE to work with [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).
It could save some time for both of us.
